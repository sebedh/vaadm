	Long: `You can use this to export the current state of your Vault installation.

For example:
vaadm export policies (to export policies to policies/ folder.)
vaadm export users (to export users to v-user-export.yaml)
vaadm export sshroles (to export sshroles to v-sshroles.yaml)`,

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// exportCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// exportCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
